# Introduction
**Quantum Computing**, a vivid Science-Fiction-esque concept embodying the humanity's march towards technological advancement, previously thought to be next to impossible. Now made entirely real and easily accessible thanks to frameworks like **IBM's Qiskit**. 

In the recent years we as the humanity had a peak into what the future will look like. 
**Machine learning and LLMs** skyrocketed in popularity, cryptography faced the threat of **quantum computing** rending numerous encryption schemes obsolete.
Everything is changing and we should keep up.

**One way to understand the change is to witness it**, that was our main premise while making this project. Quantium connects two fascinating state-of-the-art technologies, that being Quantum Computing and Machine Learning by visualizing them with graphs. 

# How it works
Our project revolves around Quantum Art, which we see best as fascinating and aesthetically pleasing graphs. 
We started out with a quantum machine learning Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) model to solve the classification problem. First, we utilized the Iris Flower dataset. Afterwards, to make the graphs even more interesting, we have programmed scrappers grabbing some NASA and ISS data. Then, graphs were created with MatplotLib and Seaborn.

We're well aware that graphs may not be art for everyone, that's why we also utilized the method for drawing Quantum Bubbles with quantum computer noise. The method we found was then modified and adjusted for the needs of our project, so that the User Experience is dynamic and simply-put beautiful.

Aside from the quantum computing and scrappers we've carefully crafted a magnificient Next.JS  Front-End. We've made sure that its design, graphs and bubbles compliment eachother perfectly.
